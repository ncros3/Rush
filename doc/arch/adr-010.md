Interruptions

# Context

The kernel need a way to handle interrupts.

As **interrupts** are a special case of **traps**, they share many mechanisms described in [exceptions](../adr-007.md). One main difference is that interrupts are **asynchronous** when exceptions are **synchronous**. This implies that the kernel need to save and restore all registers context when the trap is triggered by an interrupt. 

For reference, the figure below shows how **zephyr**, **linux** and **lk** kernels handle an interrupt event:

```C

```

# Decision

Here are **key features** of the interrupt mechanism:
- **deffered interrupt**: interrupts are handled in two phases, **critical** and **deffered** in a very similar way as [linux](https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/lectures/interrupts.html) does. In the **critical** phase, the kernel only aknowledges the interrupt and creates a task to handle it. The **deffered** phase is handled by a dedicated task which acts as a **driver**. This task has been registered by the kernel to be called when an interrupt occurs through the syscall **ax_interrupt_request()**.

```C                                                                  
     IT event                             critical phase                          deffered phase

                          get the task which is       switch to the driver task                    
                         registered in isr_table                                                                                     
```
- **no nested interrupt**: the interrupt routine cannot be interrupted, only exceptions can. This is why **critical** interrupt routine is very minimal (it only acknowledges the interrupt and wakes up the driver task): it has to be as short as possible to not degrade real-time performance.

- **full context save and restore**: caller-saved registers are saved at the beginning of the trap handler as interrupts can preempt an exception. Kernel has to be able to resume exception execution at the end of the interrupt handling.
- **no dedicated interrupt stack**: **critical** interrupt routine runs in the task context which was used by the core when the interrupt occured. Once again, as the **critical** interrupt routine is very short, the risk of a stack overflow is minimal.

The full control flow of **interrupt handling** is described here after:

```

The **driver_task** is the **deffered interrupt routine** described in the previous section. It is treated as any other **task** but it's designed to have a **high priority** such as it is **immediatly resumed when the context switch occurs in task_wakeup()**.

The **isr_table** is used to register all **interrupts handlers** (or **driver tasks**). Two **syscalls** are used to request and release interrupts from a user task:
- **ax_interrupt_request**: enables the required interrupt and save the task in the **isr_table**
- **ax_interrupt_release**: disables the required interrupt and release the corresponding handler in the **isr_table**.

The last point to address is the possibility to preempt a syscall by an interrupt. As a reminder, interrupts are disabled when a trap is triggered so we do not need to disable interrupts at the beginning of the **_trap_handler** routine (See [RISCV ISA chapter 3.1.6.1](https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-priv-isa-manual/Priv-v1.12/machine.html#machine-status-registers-mstatus-and-mstatush)). 

This implies that interrupts are disabled until they are re-enabled. When a trap is triggered by an interrupt, kernel do not need to re-enable them as **driver tasks** are expected to handle that. However, when the trap is triggered by a **syscall**, the kernel has to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible to avoid degrading real-time performance. This is done at the beginning of the **_dispatch_syscall** routine.

# Consequences

The mechanism used in anckor is a mix between the **linux** implementation and the **lk** one. Only one handler can be registered by **interrupt lane**.

The main original feature is that **interrupt handlers are managed as tasks** such as all other tasks registered in the system. This enables to re-use all features available in the kernel to schedule and run tasks.
