Accepted

# Context

performance of synchronous message passing

performance of register-based communication, do not need to handle page table management

# Decision

state diagram of tasks exchanging messages

No need to call the scheduler before **_channel_snd** as we just come from the receiving task

no need to add special states for tasks : BLOCKED is sufficient

check if a task have access to the channel with channel->in / channel->out

check if the receiving task is ready

# Consequences

Not SMP-ready right now, need to check the channel access / release protocol when receive and send task do not run on the same processor.

Also, the current implementation uses processor registers as a communication channel between tasks. That's very fast but it cannot work if tasks do not run on the same core.

Only handles register based messaging, limited amount of data
