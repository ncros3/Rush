# Architecture Design Records

This repository contains all design decisions in form of small [architecture design records](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

As a remainder, these **records** contain the following fields:
- a **title** section which describes briefly the subject of the note
- a **status** section which can be **proposed**, **accepted** or **deprecated**
- a **context** section which describes **constraints** guiding the decision: these could be technological, political or project local.
- a **decision** section which describes the solution resulting from the constraints described before.
- a **consequence** section which describes the resulting context e.g. advantages and drawbacks / limitations of the solution. Ideas for future improvement could be described shortly here.
