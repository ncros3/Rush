# Context

There are several ways to boot a kernel and main steps include **hardware initialization**, **kernel services initialization** (such as the scheduler, task management, etc...) and **launching the first task**.

As this problem has been solved in many ways before, we will take for reference several implementations in **linux**, **FreeRTOS**, **zephyr** and **lk**.

In linux, the kernel boots in [_start_kernel](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/arch/riscv/kernel/head.S#L196). It starts by some initialization then setup **sp** to [init_thread_stack](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/arch/riscv/kernel/head.S#L301). From this point, the kernel runs in the **idle process context**.

It then goes to [start_kernel](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/init/main.c#L967) which parses the device tree in [setup_arch](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/arch/riscv/kernel/setup.c#L265) and enventually calls [arch_call_rest_init->rest_init](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/init/main.c#L701). This last function creates the **init process** by calling **user_mode_thread(kernel_init, NULL, CLONE_FS)**. 

If **init process** has nothing to do, it jumps to **do_idle** which is the main idle loop. When the scheduler is called, it can switch from the **idle_task** to the **init_task** with [__switch_to](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/arch/riscv/kernel/entry.S#L536) procedure. The main thing here is that at kernel initialization we have two processes: **idle** and **init**.

One thing to note is that [kernel_init](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3/source/init/main.c#L1517) looks for the **init executable** (typically **sbin/init**) and tries to start it. At this point the kernel is fully initialized and able to run any user process.

                                               Process 1

```

An another way to handle this stage can be seen in **FreeRTOS**. The main entry point is [xPortStartScheduler](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/tasks.c#L2066). This function creates an **idle_task** then looks for the **first task** to run (which can be different from **idle** if an other task has been created before the call to **vTaskStartScheduler**). Once the first task has been found, it loads its context by calling the dedicated procedure [xPortStartFirstTask](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/GCC/RISC-V/portASM.S#L232). At the end of the boot, if no other task has been created, only the **idle_task** is running.

    └──────────┬───────────┘
               │
    ┌──────────▼───────────┐

  │                          │          Thread 0 context
  └──────────────────────────┘

  context destroyed after used
```

**Zephyr** uses a solution which is close to the linux one: once the first initialization steps are done in [reset.S](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/arch/riscv/core/reset.S#L25), it jumps to [_PrepC->z_cstart](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/kernel/init.c#L525). This function is similar to **start_kernel** in linux. It starts [two threads](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/kernel/init.c#L422): **idle** and **main** then uses a context switch routine to load the context of the main thread. One difference with linux is that zephyr uses a dedicated [stack](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/arch/riscv/core/reset.S#L80) for kernel initialization.

The last one, **lk** implements the boot sequence in the same way as **linux** and **zephyr** does. The program boots in [start.S](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk/blob/master/arch/riscv/start.S#L15) then goes to [lk_main](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk/blob/master/top/main.c#L59). As done in linux, the **idle thread** is set as the boot context (this is initialized in [thread_init_early](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk/blob/master/kernel/thread.c#L775)). Then the kernel launches as many [threads](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk/blob/master/app/app.c#L22) as needed by the application. This is similar to what **init process** does in linux but **lk** is simpler and more straighforward.

# Decision

The kernel boot sequence will follow the **linux** one (which is also similar to **zephyr** and **lk**) but will be simpler in many ways as **anckor** is far less complex than a general purpose OS.

The main advantage of this strategy is that the init sequence is running in the **idle** thread context. Then the **init** thread is simply launched with a general and lightweight **__switch_to** procedure.

```c
     ┌─────────┐
     │ __start │
     └────┬────┘
          │  set SP to _idle_stack_end
          │
          │  from here the kernel runs in idle task context
          │
  ┌───────▼───────┐
  │ platform_init │ platform specific routines,
  └───────┬───────┘
          │         drivers, etc...
          │
   ┌──────▼──────┐
   │ kernel_init │
   └──────┬──────┘
          │
          │ task_create(init_run)
          │
    ┌─────▼────┐              ┌───────────┐
    │ idle_run ├──────────────► init_task │
    └──────────┘  task_yield  └───────────┘

 │              │            │             │
 └──────────────┘            └─────────────┘
  task 0 context              task 1 context
```

Morevover, there is no need for a dedicated **boot stack** as the **idle stack** is statically defined and used throughout the boot sequence.

# Consequences

The main consequence is that we have to statically define the whole content of the **idle task** as the initialization is running in its context.

We also have two threads when the kernel finish starting. This may be overkilled for very small devices.
