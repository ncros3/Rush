# Title

Anckor test engine

# Status

Accepted

# Context

Anckor needs a tool to run all compiled tests.

# Decision

A framework has been developed which is called the "Anckor test engine". Its design is pretty straighforward and is very close in many points to the one of the [init task](../arch/adr-003.md): all tests are saved in a section defined in the linker script (see below).

```C
/* 
tests section
*/
PROVIDE(_tests_start = .);
KEEP(*(.data.tests));
PROVIDE(_tests_end = .);
```

All tests are registered with the **REGISTER_TEST()** macro, their descriptors are saved in the newly defined section. Then a routine acts as a scheduler: it creates a task for a test, runs it, store the result and repeat this process until reach the end of the section.

```C
void test_engine(void) {
  printf("ATE - Anckor tests engine\r\n");

  // iterate over all tests descriptors saved in the section(.data.tests)
  for (uint64_t *test_pt = &_tests_start; test_pt < &_tests_end; test_pt += 1) {
    // get the test descriptor from the current pointer
    test_info_t *test = (test_info_t *)*test_pt;
    // create a task for the test
    task_create(test->name, test->entry, test->stack, test->prio);

    // jump into the freshly created thread
    task_yield();
    // when the test returns, display its result
    if (test_error) {
      tests_failed += 1;
      printf("ATE - %s - failed\r\n", test->name);
    } else {
      tests_passed += 1;
      printf("ATE - %s - passed\r\n", test->name);
    }
    // create a thread for the next test and go on
  }

  // all registered tests have been runned
  if (test_error) {
    printf("ATE - FAILED - %d passed - %d failed\r\n", tests_passed,
           tests_failed);
  } else {
    printf("ATE - PASSED - %d passed - %d failed\r\n", tests_passed,
           tests_failed);
  }
}
```

Once all tests are runned, the **ATE** or **anckor test engine** displays the result:

```Shell
ATE - Anckor tests engine
ATE - apps_test - passed
ATE - threads_test - passed
ATE - PASSED - 2 passed - 0 failed
```

# Consequences

This little test scheduler runs all tests registered in the platform then send all results on the serial link.
