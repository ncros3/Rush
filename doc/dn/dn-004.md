# Title

Fast path for exception handling

# Context

As exceptions are synchronous, there is no need to save **caller-saved registers**: the compiler will do the work before calling the trap instruction **ecall**. When an exception triggers the trap, only **calle-saved registers** need to be saved.

But we need to save all registers for all other interrupts.

As exceptions handling need to be as fast as possible in a microkernel (especially **IPCs**), a dedicated path is designed to save as much **load / save instructions** as possible.

# Decision

The kernel only saves **ra** and **mepc** at the trap entry :

```C
_trap_handler:
    add	    sp, sp, -KERNEL_STACK_FRAME_LENGTH
    csrr    t0, mepc
    sd      t0, KERNEL_STACK_FRAME_MEPC(sp)
    sd	    ra, KERNEL_STACK_FRAME_RA(sp)
```

Then it only saves caller-saved registers if an interrupt is detected:

```C
    csrr	t0, mcause
    bgez    t0, 1f

    add	    sp, sp, -CALLER_STACK_FRAME_LENGTH
    SAVE_CALLER_REGS
```

After registers saving, the exception or interrupt handler is called. The return function is defined according to the trap type : **_ret_from_exception** for exceptions and **_ret_from_interrupt** for interrupts.

The only difference is that **_ret_from_interrupt** restore caller-saved registers before calling **_ret_from_exception**.
