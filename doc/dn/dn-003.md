# Title

Address alignment on RISCV targets

# Context

Several registers accepts only values with specific alignments. **mtvec** is one of these registers: the base field only accepts **4-byte** aligned address. That's why this constraint is specified when the **_trap_handler** is declared:

```ASM
# trap_handler will be stored in mtvec register and mtvec base address
# must be 4-byte aligned as defined in RISCV Privileged ISA, 3.1.7.
.align 4
.global _trap_handler
_trap_handler:
```

**_exception_vector_table** is also 4-byte aligned as all handler adresses contained in this array might be loaded in **pc** register.

# Decision

Alignment is specified for concerned functions.
