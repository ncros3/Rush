# Title

Deactivate inlining for **sched_switch** routine

# Context

When compiling kernel with -03 optimization flag, a bug appears when executing the function **sched_run()**. The root cause of the problem is that the compiler optimizes **sched_switch()** by inlining it in **sched_run**. As the progrom doesn't jump anymore in the function, **it doesn't save the return address on top of the thread's stack and doesn't pop it when exiting _switch_to**. 

This leads to a fault as the context switch mecanism heavily relies on how **sched_switch** and **_switch_to** interacts with each other.

# Decision

An option is added to forbid inlining the **sched_switch** routine

```C
#define __no_inline      __attribute__((noinline))

...

__no_inline static void sched_switch(task_t *prev_task, task_t *new_task)
```
